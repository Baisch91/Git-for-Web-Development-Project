    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? Place the head inside a header tag "<header></header>".

    15. How do I reference an id? With the "#" symbol.

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div? A section is used when the content to be put inside is grouped. A div does not have any special meaning other than separating content.

        A class can be used on many elements more than once. An ID can only be used once on a page, and have to be cautious as to what element to place it in.

    20. How do we select classes in CSS? 
        For example: if in HTML, there's something like <div class="example-class">I'm a class.</div>
        We select the class in CSS with
        .example-class {}

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””? .human {}

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? When an element is placed inside of another element, the outer element is considered the parent and the inner element is the child. The child inherits the characteristics from the parent element, as well as tack on more characteristics on top of it.
